users --> vertical : scale
vertical --> scale1

users --> horizontal : distribute
horizontal --> scale2

cpu --> partition : optimize
partition --> scale3

scale1 --> readings : 10 years
scale2 --> readings
scale3 --> pruning
pruning --> perf

note right of partition
    Monthly partitioning
    Constraint exclusion
    Efficient pruning
end note

note bottom of perf
    Maintains sub-200ms
    with billions of rows
end note
